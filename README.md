This project uses U.S. Census data to predict whether an individual earns more than $50K annually. It includes a full machine learning pipeline built in R with tidymodels, covering data cleaning, preprocessing, model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and final prediction export. The best model, Random Forest, achieved ~86.5% accuracy.
